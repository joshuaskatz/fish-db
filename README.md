This app was my first attempt at a GraphQl API with Prisma v1. I used a schema first approach in this project.

This API/database was created to store information regarding, fish, flies, tackle, river information, and fishing trips.
I used a React project, in a separate githb repository, to visualize the data in tables and mapboxgl components for river locations
and information. While this project is barebones in terms of the database and relations between tables, I used this more as a way to 
familiarize myself with GraphQL and Prisma. 

Some of the key takeaways of this project, were that I needed to dive deeper into relational data structure with SQL, 
allowing me to flesh out the database structure more, before beginning to work on the API side of things. Additionally
I am currently exploring the latest version of Prisma.
